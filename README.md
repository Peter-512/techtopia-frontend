### Get-it UX test

##### First test

User: 24-year-old woman, tech-savvy, interested in tech, but not a developer

Found a logical error in the UI:

- Filtering attractions by age or by height is flipped (fixed)

The user found all elements very easily.

##### Second test

User: ~50 years old, amusement park enthusiast, not super tech-savvy

Visitor interface was very intuitive and easy to use.

Manager interface was similarly intuitive at first glance (map view), but the user had some trouble with 
the forecast page (expected forecasts to load on date selection and did not realize buttons where clickable).
User also didn't find the create refreshment stand button.
